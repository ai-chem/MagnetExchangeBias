Magnetoelectric particles and exchange bias

## Purpose: 
to create a model predicting the shift of the hysteresis loop at low temperatures, depending on changes in the morphology of nanoparticles, material combination and the interphase interaction of ferromagnetics and antiferromagnetics 

## Background: 
Exchange bais is currently used to improve regeneration of human tissues, MRAM memory circuits, and spin electronics through empirical selection of a new hard layer of magnet. Advanced carriers use exchange bais to increase the stability of small magnetic particles whose properties without correction by a magnet would be superparamagnetic. Our model will predict the magnetic properties of different nanoparticle alloys that could be used for electronics, but are not yet in use.
